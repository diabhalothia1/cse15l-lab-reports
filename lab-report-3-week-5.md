The command I'm going to explore is <span style="color: red;">GREP</span> 

1. -n
The first example of using -n
It gives the line number in which a particular word is contained in a file

The doce for using -n to get the line number of lines conatining that keyword-\
'grep -n <keyword> <filepath>
  
I used this to find the appearence of "unknown" in the file "chapter-1.txt"
